## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Ran into issues displaying names and info of other uses, but that was solved with ACL permissions. Also ran into issues getting photos with location meta data to demo in the video. The video will show me
dragging a photo into the app, but not posting it as it has no location
